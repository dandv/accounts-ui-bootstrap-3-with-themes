# accounts-ui-bootstrap-3 with themes that create problems

Edit the HTML and change the theme to one of:

* cerulean - can't see "Forgot password?" / "Create account" links in narrow width
* united - same as above
* yeti - link onhover color too close to background color
* darkly - no borders around inputs; on wide screen: bright green on white links
